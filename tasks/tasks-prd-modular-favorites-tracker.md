# Task List: Modular Favorites Tracker

## ðŸš¨ **MAJOR STATUS UPDATE** (December 2024)
**Discovery**: Project is **~70% complete**, not 28% as previously documented
- **Phase 1**: âœ… 100% Complete (14/14 tasks)
- **Phase 2**: âœ… 85% Complete (8.5/10 tasks) - **SUBSTANTIAL UNDOCUMENTED PROGRESS**  
- **Phase 3**: ðŸ”„ 15% Started (1.5/11 tasks) - **CRITICAL MVP BLOCKERS IDENTIFIED**

**Key Finding**: Backend infrastructure is over-built for MVP. Missing core UI features are blocking user functionality.

**Immediate Priority**: Shift from backend optimization to UI implementation (item forms, detail views, photo upload).

- **Test-First Development (TDD):** Write comprehensive tests before implementation
- Firebase backend (Firestore, Auth, Storage, Cloud Functions)
- Firebase emulator setup for local development and testing
- Component-based template system with modular architecture
- Premium subscription model with marketplace integration
- Universal app supporting both iPhone and iPad
- Set iOS Deployment Target to 26.0 in project settings
- Use latest iOS 26 SDKs and SwiftUI features available in Xcode Beta
